Conducted an A/B test to compare user conversion rates between the old (Control) and new (Treatment) landing pages. Calculated conversion rates, performed statistical tests (z-test and confidence intervals), and visualized results. Found no statistically significant difference, indicating the new page does not improve conversions.
